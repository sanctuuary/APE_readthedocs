Overview
========

The use cases aim to describe the domain knowledge that has to be 
provided, comprising `Domain ontology <../../specifications/setup.html#domain-model>`_ and 
`Tool annotations <../../specifications/setup.html#tool-annotations-file>`_).

Each of the uses cases represent a different scenario:

* `ImageMagick <imagemagick/imagemagick.html>`_ - a basic demonstration case of editing and constructing images using automaticaly synthesised scripts

  * `Example 1 <imagemagick/imagemagick.html#example-1>`_ - generate a postcard from an image
  * `Example 2 <imagemagick/imagemagick.html#example-2>`_ - change one color in the image to another color

* `GeoGMT <geo_gmt/geo_gmt.html>`_ - case of solving a problem of map creation presented it [1]_.

  * `E0 <geo_gmt/geo_gmt.html#e0-initial-workflow>`_ - focuses on the initial workflow sinthesys step, labeled as **E0** in the paper.
  * `E1 <geo_gmt/geo_gmt.html#e1-additional-constraints>`_ - focuses on synthesis of an extended workflow (w.r.t. *E0*), labeled as **E1** in the paper (Extension 1: Annotations).

* `MassSpectometry <massspectrometry/massspectrometry.html>`_ - case of automated workflow composition in bioinformatics. more specifically mass spectrometry-based proteomics [2]_. 
  
  * `No1 <massspectrometry/massspectrometry.html#no-1>`_ - use case describes the 1st Use Case described in the paper, labeled as **No. 1**.
