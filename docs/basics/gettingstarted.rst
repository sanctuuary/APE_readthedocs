My first APE run
================

Automated workflow composition with APE can be performed through its 
command line interface (`CLI <../specifications/cli.html>`_), its application programming interface 
(`java API <../specifications/java.html>`_) or the RESTful API (`RESTful APE <../restful-ape/introduction.html>`_). 
The CLI provides a simple means to interact and experiment 
with the framework, while the java API provides more flexibility and control over 
the synthesis process. It can be used to integrate APEâ€™s functionality 
into other systems. Finally, the RESTful API provides an interface for users to 
engage with APE's automated pipeline exploration capabilities through HTTP requests. RESTful API is also provided as a Docker container for easy deployment and management.

My first APE run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first APE run is demonstrated using the CLI. The following steps guide you through the process of setting up and running APE on a simple example.

Get the latest version of `APE_UseCases <https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases>`_ 
by either `downloading the main <https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases/archive/main.zip>`_
(zip) or cloning the repository: 

.. .. code-block:: shell
.. 
..     git clone git@github.com:sanctuuary/APE_UseCases.git

.. or

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE_UseCases.git


Download the latest version of `APE-2.3.0-executable.jar <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/sanctuuary/APE/2.3.0/APE-2.3.0-executable.jar>`_ 
and add it to the root of the project (``~/git/APE_UseCases``).
Navigate to the root of the project and execute the jar with an 
argument that is a (relative) path to the configuration file.

.. code-block:: shell

    cd ~/git/APE_UseCases
    java -jar APE-2.3.0-executable.jar ImageMagick/Example1/config.json

See `Use cases and Demos <../demo/demo-overview.html>`_ for more information about the results 
and on how to execute the composed workflow.
