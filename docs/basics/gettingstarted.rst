Getting Started with APE
========================

Automated workflow composition with APE can be performed through its 
command line interface (`CLI <../specifications/cli.html>`_) or its application programming interface 
(`API <../specifications/java.html>`_). While the CLI provides a simple means to interact and experiment 
with the framework, the API provides more flexibility and control over 
the synthesis process. It can be used to integrate APEâ€™s functionality 
into other systems.
