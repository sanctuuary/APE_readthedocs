Introduction to RESTful APE
===========================
 
`RESTful APE <https://github.com/sanctuuary/restape>`_ is a **RESTful API** for the **APE** library (see `documentation <https://ape-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_).  It offers an interface for users to engage with APE's automated pipeline exploration capabilities through HTTP requests. APE, both a command line tool and a Java API, facilitates the automatic exploration of computational pipelines from extensive collections of computational tools.

With the RESTful API, users can submit requests to the APE server for pipeline exploration, receiving results in standardized formats like JSON or XML. This API can be accessed through a web browser or any HTTP client, allowing for integration into various applications for streamlined pipeline exploration.


**Key Features:**

- **Automated Pipeline Exploration:** Automate the exploration of computational pipelines from a broad collection of tools.
- **Standardized Results:** Receive exploration results in JSON format.
- **Flexible Integration:** Use APE through a web browser or any HTTP client, enabling easy integration into other applications.
- **Docker Support:** Run RESTful APE as a Docker container for easy deployment and management (see `Docker image <https://github.com/sanctuuary/restape/pkgs/container/restape>`_).

This makes the RESTful API for APE a potent and adaptable tool for enhancing scientific workflows with APE's capabilities.
