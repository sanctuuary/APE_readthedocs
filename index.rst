Welcome to APEâ€™s documentation!
===============================

APE (Automated Pipeline Explorer) is a library (available as CLI, Java API and a RESTful API) for the automated exploration of possible computational pipelines (scientific workflows) from large collections of computational tools. It also comes with a RESTful API interface. APE was originally developed at Utrecht University and is now maintained by the Netherlands eScience Center.
